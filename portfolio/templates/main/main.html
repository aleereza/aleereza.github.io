<p> 
I am a code enthusiast. I enjoy python so I make web application with Django, but the best part is to see the results and play with it, for that, I use Javascript and Bootstrap. These days my main hobby is implementing machine learning algorithms in web applications.
I also have a passion for design, and itâ€™s all about create things that make me feel good.
